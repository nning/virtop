== Installation ==

Add gems.github.com as a source for gems and install elliottcable-ncurses from
this mirror, because there is no version on rubygems.org which works with ruby
1.9.

 * gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
 * gem install elliottcable-ncurses

Build the virtop gem and install it.

 * gem build virtop.gemspec
 * gem install virtop-*.gem

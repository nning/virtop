== Installation ==

The recommended way for installation is to add gems.github.com as a source
for gems (especially elliottcable-ncurses, which is used to provide a ruby
1.9.1 compatible ncurses library), build the virtop gem and install it:

 * gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
 * gem build virtop.gemspec
 * gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc virtop-*.gem

== Installation ==

Add gems.github.com as a source for gems and install elliottcable-ncurses from
this mirror, because there is no version on rubygems.org which works with ruby
1.9.

 * gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
 * gem install elliottcable-ncurses

Build the virtop gem and install it. Do not build ri and rdoc documentation for
this would throw nasty errors.

 * gem build virtop.gemspec
 * gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc virtop-*.gem
